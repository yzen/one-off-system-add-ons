This add-on attempts to correct cases where the built-in Firefox Google search
engine either had no codes or incorrect codes.

Firefox 43-45 - Google engine had no codes. We add them.
                To test this, verify that our codes are added to any Google search,
                verifying different codes for US and non-US.
Firefox 46-56 - In the US and Taiwan, we were using google-nocodes. We add codes in those cases.
                To test this, turn off browser.search.geoSpecificDefaults.
